Description:
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of TikTok data, focusing on data cleaning, structuring, and visualization using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal is to provide insights into TikTok video metrics, including video duration, like counts, comment counts, view counts, and author ban status. Visualizations include comparisons of claim counts to opinion counts and boxplots to identify outliers in key variables. The notebook is structured to guide through the steps of importing data, exploring and cleaning the dataset, building visualizations, and evaluating results.

Key Features:
Data structuring and cleaning
Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Analysis of TikTok video metrics and author ban status
Guidance on identifying and handling outliers
